#Introduction
For those who want to harvest there Github, this program is for you. But on a serious note, DO NOT use it.

#Working
Scraps something from the internet and pushes to your github repo. You can create a desktop shortcut for this proram, and by making the pogram executable, only by double-clicking the desktop shortcut, the scraped material is pushed to your github repo.

#Conclusion
Thus if you execute the program, it will push something to your repo, i.e. it will look, as if you have committed something to your codebase, which you actaully haven't.
This program is written just for fun, I do not want anyone to want this, just because they can fake pushes.
